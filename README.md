This repo is a collection of notes and technical logs I've made whilst troubleshooting 3D printers and/or upgrading equipment.

This is by no means a guide on how to do anything! I am a fella just bumbling around in this field and there are plenty of experts out there with a wealth of knowledge to share.

In the immortal words of a [handsome man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqw-f-lTz-A), we're just here _Shoot'n The Poop_...

Anyways! Here are the printers I currently have in my collection:

1 - Creality

1.1 - CR-10

1.2 - Ender-3 `a.k.a` _Mark_

1.3 - Ender-3 V2 `a.k.a` _Mark II_


2 - Prusa

2.1 - MK3S+


Thanks for stopping by!
