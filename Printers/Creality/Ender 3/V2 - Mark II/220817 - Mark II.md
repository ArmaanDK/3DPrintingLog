## Issues

[1. Bed Adhesion]

[2. Stringy Print Artifacts]



### 1. Bed Adhesion
Issue: Bed Adhesion Sporadic
Diagnosis: Indented center of bed when all corners are level
Solution: Mesh bed leveling

Ordered [CR-Touch](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B098LQ9WPX/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) from Amazon CA to arrive by tomorrow, 220817

### 2. Stringy Print Artifacts
Issue: Strands of filament build-up on nozzle and eventually stick to print
Diagnosis: Plastic still on nozzle from the warm-up period
Solution: Add a nozzle wipe to the starting g-code

Added the following to the "Start G-Code"[1] in slicing software:
```
G1 Z2.0 F3000 ; Move Z Axis up little to prevent scratching of Heat Bed
G1 X0.1 Y20 Z0.3 F5000.0 ; Move to start position
M300 P250 ; play chime to indicate print starting
G1 X0.1 Y200.0 Z0.3 F1500.0 E15 ; Draw the first line
G1 X0.4 Y200.0 Z0.3 F5000.0 ; Move to side a little
G1 X0.4 Y20 Z0.3 F1500.0 E30 ; Draw the second line
G92 E0 ; Reset Extruder
G1 Z2.0 F3000 ; Move Z Axis up little to prevent scratching of Heat Bed
G1 X5 Y20 Z0.3 F5000.0 ; Move over to prevent blob squish
```
